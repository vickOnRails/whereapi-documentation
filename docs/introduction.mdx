If you’ve worked on a product that required collecting and indexing location-related information for an African audience, I bet you’d agree this experience is pretty fragmented.

You could take one of 3 approaches

- **Free form**: Allow users enter their location themselves. This will be the easiest approach, but it'll eventually hurt you. You'll have a database of hot mess caused by people who can't spell `Nassarrawwa`.
- **Home grown**: Index and maintain a database of locations and their relationships. I've learned this is how most people solve this problem and it works well for very large apps. What about side projects?
- **Third Party APIs**: Get on-demand location-related information. Get information for a country, state, filter fields, search country, etc.

Where API follows the third approach. And is a quite straightforward way to collect and index location-related information for countries in Africa.

## Use cases

- In a side project for collecting location information
- Building a frontend to consume the API and index locations

:::caution
WhereAPI is currently in development and shouldn't be used in production. A v1.0 should be ready by the end of March 2021. Location-related functionality is currrently available for Nigeria and Kenya.
