What's an API without a searchðŸ˜³?

You can search on all resources that return multiple records. Let's see an example that searches for a particular state (Lagos) in Nigeria.

```bash
curl https://whereapis-africa.herokuapp.com/api/countries/f794ecd7-679e-4989-9be6-e081ac2f7145/states?search=lagos -H "your apikey here"
```

Our response

```json

  "success": true,

## Current Limitations

Search is on the `name` field. So you have to know the name of the state you're searching for. Ideally, Search should work on all fields and should be full text, but this is a little complex for me to approach at the moment.

I hope to implement it sometime in the future.
