The fastest way to get started with WhereAPI is to create an account.

Next, generate your API keys. Your API keys should look something like this `cdad871a-debd-4025-bf06-0744d80ad3ab`.

Once you have your keys, you can go ahead to consume the API.

:::info
Where implements rate limiting and you can make only 60 requests per hour. This is because it's a minimal setup and this easiest way to keep the server stable and cost efficient.

## Authentication

Once you have your API keys, you can now make requests by passing them with the `x-api-key` header. Here is an example if you're using with a React setup.

### Test with JavaScript (React)

```js
const baseUrl = `https://api.whereapi.xyz/api/`;

// I'm putting the API key here for a straightforward setup.
// You should put set it up as an environmental variable. See
const apiKey = `cdad871a-debd-4025-bf06-0744d80ad3ab`;

useEffect(() => {
    const { data } = await fetch(url, {
        // pass the api key with the x-api-key header
        "x-api-key": apiKey
    });
}, []);
```

### Test with Postman

Or you could try a postman setup. Try sending a get request to `https://api.whereapi.xyz/api` with the `x-api-key` heading set to your api key. It'll look something like this

### Test with curl

curl is a command-line tool for transfering data. It supports HTTP and other protocols. We can test our endpoints with `curl`

```bash
curl -v https://whereapis-africa.herokuapp.com/api/
```

It should return something like this

```bash
StatusCode        : 200
StatusDescription : OK
Content           : {"message":"API/"}
RawContent        : HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                    Connection: keep-alive
                    Content-Length: 18
                    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
                    Date: Tue, 16 Mar 2021 10:13:09 GMT
                    ETag: W/"12-en1E0QQbd2dl5z1XdkbnvJn4bK0"
                    Server: Cowbo...
Forms             : {}
Headers           : {[Connection, keep-alive], [Content-Length, 18], [Content-Type,
                    application/json; charset=utf-8], [Date, Tue, 16 Mar 2021 10:13:09
                    GMT]...}
Images            : {}
InputFields       : {}
Links             : {}
ParsedHtml        : System.__ComObject
RawContentLength  : 18

```

You can also try to request a protected endpoint without the `x-api-key` set. You'll get an error.

```bash
curl -v https://whereapis-africa.herokuapp.com/api/countries
```

You'll get an error

```bash
curl : {"message":"Authentication error. Please attach an API key to your requests"}
At line:1 char:1
+ curl -v https://whereapis-africa.herokuapp.com/api/countries
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (System.Net.HttpWebRequest:HttpWebRequest)
   [Invoke-WebRequest], WebException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebCmdletWebResponseException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.I
   nvokeWebRequestCommand
```

Then pass the `x-api-key` header alongside your key.

```bash
curl -v https://whereapis-africa.herokuapp.com/api/countries -H 'X-Api-Key:cdad871a-debd-4025-bf06-0744d80ad3ab'
```

You should get something like this

```bash
# It should look a bit rougher than this

100   196  100   196    0     0      8      0  0:00:24  0:00:23  0:00:01    42

[
    {
        "id":"f794ecd7-679e-4989-9be6-e081ac2f7145",
        "name":"Nigeria",
        "description":"Largest country in Africa",
        "code":"NG",
        "createdAt":"2021-03-15T10:26:05.644Z",
        "updatedAt":"2021-03-15T10:26:05.644Z"
    }
]
```

:::info
You should use a `bash` program as curl doesn't work on all terminals. Try git bash or someother bash.

If these works, congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰. You're set to do whatever you want with the API. Now you have your API keys, let's move to how you would make use of the API.

Onwards ðŸ¤ºðŸ¤ºðŸ¤º
