I think this will be an app that recursively navigates countries, states, LGAs etc for Nigeria and Kenya. It’ll be in darkmode. It’ll also be heavily paginated so I can show basic how pagination works in the API. The data for the tutorial will first be with dummy json data which will be replaced with the API in segments of the tutorial.
